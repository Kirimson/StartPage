# StartPage

A small, simple and modern StartPage. Built for anyone, but especially you.

<h1>Usage</h1>

To access the StartPage. visit https://kirimson.github.io/StartPage/

When first visiting StartPage, you'll be prompted with the settings window. Here you can customise StartPage however you like. Customisation details can be found below.

<h1>Features</h1>
StartPage has 3 main features. The links sidebar, the search and weather.
<h2>links sidebar</h2>
Here is where all your links will live, neatly organised (if you want them to be!) into sections of your choice. Click on a section to expand it, and click a link to go to the site
<h2>Search box</h2>
The search box, arguably the best feature of StartPage, allowing you to search, go to your links and instantly search certain sites too!
<h2>Weather</h2>
Allow location services to find the weather in your local area. No other information about your location is used, look at the source if you can’t take my word. The forecast gives you the current temperature, and the forecasted temperature for the next 5 days.
<h2>Themes</h2>
Throughout the day, the theme of the site will change slightly, with different background images and colour schemes, all which can be customised by you if you want. The times are as follows:
<ul>
<li>9AM to 12PM - Morning</li>
<li>12PM to 6PM - Morning</li>
<li>6PM to 1AM - Evening</li>
<li>1PM to 9AM - Night</li>
</ul>

<h1>Customisation</h1>
This section will detail how StartPage can be customised. Click the settings button at the bottom right of the page to access the settings page. When you're done customising, click 'Update Settings' to save your changes.
<h2>Links</h2>
The main part of StartPage is custom links. These links, like bookmarks, let you access any site you list at a press of a few keys or a couple clicks.

Links are set up in a specific syntax:
\Section Title
Website name
website URL

Each section begins with a backslash, denoting the title of the new section. On a new line is the first website name, and under that is its URL. Repeat website names and URLs as much as you like. When you want to create a new section, on a new line enter another backslash and the next sections title on that line, then continue with the new section you created.

<h2>Backgrounds</h2>
Enter 'default' in the text box to set the background for the specified theme to the default image. Paste in an image link to use that image as your background for that theme

<h2>Colours</h2>
Use the arrows at the top to switch between themes, with the current theme being selected by default. Use any CSS accepted colour code to change the colour of each element. With a small preview at the bottom of the setting pane.
<h2>Text</h2>
Like the colours, click the arrows at the top of the setting pane to switch theme, and edit the text that appears at the top of the screen. Click the default button to set it back to the default image
<h2>Minimalistic Mode</h2>
In the ‘Help and Misc Settings. Section there is an option for minimalistic mode, a mode where the links sidebar and weather sections are hidden, and the screen is replaced with your greeting text, and upon typing, the search bar appears.
